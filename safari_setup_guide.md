# Safari Setup for Web Automation

Before running the LinkedIn scraper with Safari, you need to enable the necessary developer settings:

## Enable Safari Automation

1. Open Safari
2. Go to Safari menu > Settings (or Preferences in older versions)
3. Click on the "Advanced" tab
4. Check the box that says "Show Develop menu in menu bar"
5. Now, click on the "Develop" menu that appears in the menu bar
6. Check the option "Allow Remote Automation"

## Additional Safari Settings

1. In the Safari menu, go to "Settings" > "Websites" > "Pop-up Windows"
2. Make sure LinkedIn.com is set to "Allow" for pop-ups
3. Go to "Settings" > "Privacy" and ensure "Prevent cross-site tracking" is unchecked (temporarily, for the scraping session)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Make sure you've restarted Safari after changing the settings
2. Try running the script with administrator privileges
3. If you get a permission dialog, make sure to click "Allow"

After completing your scraping task, you may want to revert the privacy settings back to their original state for better security.
